This level is achieved at the basic level of society where the women and men get the same rights to grow in every sphere of life.\nA little sneak in near history, the Industrial revolution and the world wars I and II created more work opportunities for women. Women started to get more rights and secure workplaces compared to previous times. Also, the patriarchal mindset in society changed a lot after women rights campaigns and struggles.\nIn the present day, we see much improvement and development in women roles in different fields, especially STEM. Different scenarios have strengthened their roles and jobs even more, e.g., the recent covid epidemic in 2020 caused havoc throughout the world, but on the other hand, it created dignified job opportunities for women at home.\nAll these facts show the betterment in jobs and equal pay for women, but still the number of women in advance fields specially STEM remain male dominant. This difference in gender participation in professional domain needs deep research and analysis of work environments and cultures to encourage and facilitate more indulgence of females in STEM sectors, esp., data sciences.

To get the best analysis outcomes, columns containing various options of related questions were combined through concatenation. This process was done for the survey questions related to platforms, IDEs, hosted notebook products, visualization libraries, ML frameworks, computer vision methods, NLP methods, data products, business intelligence tools, automated ML tools, monitoring tools, ethical AI products, specialized hardware, favorite media sources, use of ML in research, downloading of pre-trained model weights and important work activities. \n\nThe data was then visualized through various figures to show the underlying relations between the different data columns, depicting the roadmap followed by majority of professionals in the STEM industry. \n\nAt the end, application of Chi-squared test rejected the proposed hypothesis, concluding the fact that women (even if in small numbers in STEM industry) are making the similar technological choices as that made by men.

The less number of women in STEM might be caused by other under lying factors, such as maternity, patriarchy and cultural biasness mentioned in research work [1][2]. In future, it is suggested that kaggle survey should also encompass questions related to the mentioned factors as well, in order to gather beneficial information regarding less number of women in STEM. \nA roadmap is also drawn in Figure 39 (flow chart), in which the essential choices in STEM roles made by women are shown.
